## Use and Setup

1.) Installation 

```
  npm i react-big-schedule
```

or

```
  yarn add react-big-schedule
```

2.) Import dependencies

```
import { Scheduler, SchedulerData, ViewType, DATE_FORMAT } from "react-big-schedule";
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import "react-big-schedule/dist/css/style.css";
```

3.) Basic Usage
```js
const schedulerData = new SchedulerData( new dayjs().format(DATE_FORMAT), ViewType.Week );

//set locale dayjs to the schedulerData, if your locale isn't English. By default, Scheduler comes with English(en, United States).
schedulerData.setSchedulerLocale("pt-br"); // this uses dayjs, but it doesn't require dayjs to be installed as its called dynamically
schedulerData.setCalendarPopoverLocale("pt_BR"); // this uses antd [List of supported locales](https://ant.design/docs/react/i18n#supported-languages)

schedulerData.setResources([
  { id: "r0", name: "Resource0", groupOnly: true},
  { id: "r1", name: "Resource1" },

  { id: "r3", name: "Resource3", parentId: "r4" },
  { id: "r4", name: "Resource4", parentId: "r2" },
]);

// the event array should be sorted in ascending order by event.start property
// otherwise there will be some rendering errors
schedulerData.setEvents([
  {
    id: 1,
    start: "2022-12-18 09:30:00",

# API


### SchedulerData

SchedulerData is the view model of Scheduler, we can modify it to control the view of the Scheduler.

#### constructor

```js
constructor(date=dayjs().format(DATE_FORMAT), viewType = ViewType.Week,
                showAgenda = false, isEventPerspective = false,
                newConfig = undefined, newBehaviors=undefined
                localeDayjs = undefined)
```

- `date` is a string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and is the initial date Scheduler will render. Take the date `2022-12-20`
  for example, Scheduler will render the time window of the week from `2022-12-18` to `2022-12-24` in `ViewType.Week`
  view type, and will render the time window of the `2022-12` month in `ViewType.Month` view type.
- `viewType` is the initial view type, now Scheduler supports `Day`, `Week`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Year` 5 built-in view types,
  in addition Scheduler now supports `Custom`, `Custom1`, `Custom2` 3 custom view types at the same time, in which you can control
  the time window yourself, refer to [this example](https://stephenchou1017.github.io/scheduler/#/customtimewindow). `viewType`,
  `showAgenda` and `isEventPerspective` are a group which should be contained in the SchedulerData.config.views array,
  and they together decide which view should be rendered. When `showAgenda` and `isEventPerspective` are both `false`,
  Scheduler will render the resource view, refer to [this example](https://stephenchou1017.github.io/scheduler/#/views).
- `showAgenda` is a bool value, if true, Scheduler will display the agenda view of current view type. Agenda view is
  read only.
- `isEventPerspective` is a bool value, if true, Scheduler will display the task view of current view type. In
  resource view, every slot(row) describes how many events a resource does in the time window, while in task view,
  every slot describes how many events a big task is divided into and who will make it done. Add a `groupId` and
  `groupName` property to every event object, so that the events having the same `groupId` will belong to the same big task and
  be rendered in the same slot in task view. If `groupId` and `groupName` are not provided, SchedulerData will take
  the `id` as the `groupId`, and take the `title` as the `groupName`. See the `eventsForTaskView` in the
  [sample1.js](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/sample-data/sample1.js) for details.
- `newConfig` is a config object, used to override the [default config](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/config/scheduler.js)
  fully or partly.
- `newBehaviors` is a config object, used to override the [default behaviors](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/helper/behaviors.js)
  fully or partly.
- `localeDayjs` is a locale dayjs object, which is unified used in react-big-scheduler. If not provided, Scheduler will come
  with English(en, United States) locale strings.

#### setSchedulerLocale

```js
setSchedulerLocale(preset);
```

Used to set locale to the scheduler, it uses dayjs locales ([List of supported locales](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale)) and it is loaded on demand.

`preset` will be locale imported from dayjs.

#### example:
```js
import * as dayjsLocale from 'dayjs/locale/pt-br';

setSchedulerLocale(dayjsLocale);
```

By default, Scheduler comes with English(en, United States)

#### setCalendarPopoverLocale

```js
setCalendarPopoverLocale(lang);
```

Used to set locale to the calendar popover. it uses antd locales ([List of supported locales](https://ant.design/docs/react/i18n#supported-languages)). By default, it comes with English(en, United States)

#### example:
```js
import * as antdLocale from 'antd/locale/pt_BR';

setCalendarPopoverLocale(antdLocale);
```

refer this for the demo of the locale.

#### setResources

```js
setResources(resources);
```

Used to set the resources(the slots in resource view), make sure that there are no duplicated `resource.id` in the `resources`.
See the demo `resources` in the [sample1.js](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/sample-data/sample1.js).

#### setEvents

```js
setEvents(events);
```

Used to set the events. the event array should be sorted in ascending order by event.start property.
See the demo `events` in the [sample1.js](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/sample-data/sample1.js).
If we use the task view, we'd better add the `groupId` and the `groupName` property to each event object, see the
`eventsForTaskView` in the [sample1.js](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/sample-data/sample1.js) for details.

#### prev

```js
prev();
```

Let the time window scroll to the left once. When `SchedulerData,viewType` is `ViewType.Month`, the time window will
scroll a month, when `SchedulerData,viewType` is `ViewType.Week`, the time window will scroll a week. `SchedulerData.events`
will be clear after calling this method.


#### next

```js
next();
```

Let the time window scroll to the right once. `SchedulerData.events` will be clear after calling this method.

#### setDate

```js
setDate((date = dayjs().format(DATE_FORMAT)));
```

Let the time window jump to the provided `date` directly. `SchedulerData.events` will be clear after calling this method.

#### setViewType

```js
setViewType(
  (viewType = ViewType.Week),
  (showAgenda = false),
  (isEventPerspective = false)
);
```

Tell SchedulerData to change current view, the `viewType`, `showAgenda` and `isEventPerspective` group should be
provided, and should be contained in the `SchedulerData.config.views` array. `SchedulerData.events` will be clear
after calling this method.

#### setEventGroups

```js
setEventGroups(eventGroups);
```

Used to set the event groups(the slots in task view), make sure that there are no duplicated `eventGroup.id` in the `eventGroups`.
This method is optional, and is needed only when `SchedulerData.eventGroupsAutoGenerated` is `false`.

#### setEventGroupsAutoGenerated

```js
setEventGroupsAutoGenerated(autoGenerated);
```

Tell SchedulerData to generate `SchedulerData.eventGroups` automatically or not. If `true`, SchedulerData will generate the event
groups(slots) automatically according to the `event.groupId` and 'event.groupName' automatically. If `groupId` and 'groupName' are
not provided, SchedulerData will take `event.id` and `event.title` instead.

#### setMinuteStep

```js
setMinuteStep(minuteStep);
```

Used to set minute step for daily view and refresh the render data.

#### toggleExpandStatus

```js
toggleExpandStatus(slotId);
```

Used to toggle slot's(and its children's) expand status.

#### getMinuteStepsInHour

```js
getMinuteStepsInHour();
```

Used to get minute steps in an hour, it equals 60 / SchedulerData.config.minuteStep.

#### addResource

```js
addResource(resource);
```

Add the `resource` to the `SchedulerData.resources`, make sure that `resource.id` is not duplicated. Refer
to [this example](https://stephenchou1017.github.io/scheduler/#/addresource).

#### addEventGroup

```js
addEventGroup(eventGroup);
```

Add the `eventGroup` to the `SchedulerData.eventGroups`, make sure that `eventGroup.id` is not duplicated. Please note
that the `eventGroup` added may be override when `SchedulerData.eventGroupsAutoGenerated` is `true` and
`SchedulerData.eventGroups` is auto-generated.

#### addEvent

```js
addEvent(newEvent);
```

Add the `newEvent` to the `SchedulerData.events`, make sure that `newEvent.id` is not duplicated. SchedulerData will
place the `newEvent` in the right index according to the `newEvent.start` property.

#### updateEventStart

```js
updateEventStart(event, newStart);
```

Update the `newStart` to the `event.start`, `newStart` is a string in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format(similarly hereinafter).
SchedulerData will replace the `event` in the right index according to the `newStart` value.

#### updateEventEnd

```js
updateEventEnd(event, newEnd);
```

Update the `newEnd` to the `event.end`.

#### moveEvent

```js
moveEvent(event, newSlotId, newSlotName, newStart, newEnd);
```

Update the `newSlotId`, `newSlotName`, `newStart`, `newEnd` of the `event`. In resource view, new slot is a resource,
while in task view, new slot is a event group. SchedulerData will replace the `event` in the right index according
to the `newStart` value.

#### removeEvent

```js
removeEvent(event);
```

Remove the given event from `SchedeulerData.events`.

#### removeEventById

#### getResourceById

```js
getResourceById(resourceId);
```

#### isEventInTimeWindow

```js
isEventInTimeWindow(eventStart, eventEnd, windowStart, windowEnd);
```

Returns whether an event is in the time window or not, remind that `eventStart`, `eventEnd`, `windowStart`, `windowEnd`
are all dayjs | Date objects.

#### getViewDates

```js
getViewDates();
```

Returns an object with the startDate and endDate of the currently selected view ({ startDate: Dayjs, endDate: Dayjs }).

#### getViewStartDate

```js
getViewStartDate();
```

Returns a dayjs object with the startDate of the currently selected view.

#### getViewEndDate

```js
getViewEndDate();
```

### Locale support(Refer to [this example](https://stephenchou1017.github.io/scheduler/#/locale) for details.)

#### SchedulerData.config.resourceName

The locale string of resource name.

#### SchedulerData.config.taskName

The locale string of task name.

#### SchedulerData.config.agendaViewHeader

The locale string of agenda view header.

#### SchedulerData.config.addMorePopoverHeaderFormat

The locale string of add more popover header format.

#### SchedulerData.config.eventItemPopoverDateFormat

The locale string of event item popover date format.

#### SchedulerData.config.nonAgendaDayCellHeaderFormat

### SchedulerData.config(See the [config file](https://github.com/react-scheduler/react-big-schedule/blob/master/src/config/scheduler.js) for details.)

#### schedulerWidth

The width of Scheduler. Scheduler uses responsive layout so schedulerWidth should be a percentage,
Scheduler in the responsive layout:
`actual width of Scheduler = (SchedulerData.documentWidth - SchedulerData.config.besidesWidth) * SchedulerData.config.schedulerWidth`
`SchedulerData.documentWidth` is the window width of browser (or the the parent width in case SchedulerData.config.responsiveByParent
and Scheduler component prop parentRef is passed) and will change automatically when resized.

#### responsiveByParent

When true, Scheduler resposiveness will not be determined by the window width of browser but instead by the
width of the of the parent (the parent ref must be passed to the Scheduler component prop named `parentRef`,
in case it is not passed resposiveness will fall back to being determined by the window width).
Meaning:
`SchedulerData.documentWidth` is the width of the parent and will change automatically when resized

#### schedulerMaxHeight

`SummaryPos.BottomRight` and `SummaryPos.BottomLeft`.

#### startResizable

Controls whether to resize the start of every event item in resource view and task view. If `false`, all item starts are
non-resizable, if `true`, all item starts are resizable except those who have a `resizable` or `startResizable`
property and its value is `false`.

#### endResizable

Controls whether to resize the end of every event item in resource view and task view. If `false`, all item ends are
non-resizable, if `true`, all item ends are resizable except those who have a `resizable` or `endResizable`
property and its value is `false`.
